c0b454e0a6aa51ff3ba56778787d0c43932ef6ba,Yi: Open Foundation Models by 01.AI,We introduce the Yi model family, a series of language and multimodal models that demonstrate strong multi-dimensional capabilities. The Yi model family is based on 6B and 34B pretrained language models, then we extend them to chat models, 200K long context models, depth-upscaled models, and vision-language models. Our base models achieve strong performance on a wide range of benchmarks like MMLU, and our finetuned chat models deliver strong human preference rate on major evaluation platforms like AlpacaEval and Chatbot Arena. Building upon our scalable super-computing infrastructure and the classical transformer architecture, we attribute the performance of Yi models primarily to its data quality resulting from our data-engineering efforts. For pretraining, we construct 3.1 trillion tokens of English and Chinese corpora using a cascaded data deduplication and quality filtering pipeline. For finetuning, we polish a small scale (less than 10K) instruction dataset over multiple iterations such that every single instance has been verified directly by our machine learning engineers. For vision-language, we combine the chat language model with a vision transformer encoder and train the model to align visual representations to the semantic space of the language model. We further extend the context length to 200K through lightweight continual pretraining and demonstrate strong needle-in-a-haystack retrieval performance. We show that extending the depth of the pretrained checkpoint through continual pretraining further improves performance. We believe that given our current results, continuing to scale up model parameters using thoroughly optimized data will lead to even stronger frontier models.
3936fd3c6187f606c6e4e2e20b196dbc41cc4654,Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback,As AI systems become more capable, we would like to enlist their help to supervise other AIs. We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them. Both the SL and RL methods can leverage chain-of-thought style reasoning to improve the human-judged performance and transparency of AI decision making. These methods make it possible to control AI behavior more precisely and with far fewer human labels.

This paper explores the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) to streamline the clinical documentation process, specifically focusing on generating SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) notes. We present a case study demonstrating the application of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) technologies to transcribe patient-clinician interactions, coupled with advanced prompting techniques to generate draft clinical notes using large language models (LLMs). The study highlights the benefits of this approach, including time savings, improved documentation quality, and enhanced patient-centered care. Additionally, we discuss ethical considerations, such as maintaining patient confidentiality and addressing model biases, underscoring the need for responsible deployment of generative AI in healthcare settings. The findings suggest that generative AI has the potential to revolutionize clinical documentation practices, alleviating administrative burdens and enabling healthcare professionals to focus more on direct patient care.
